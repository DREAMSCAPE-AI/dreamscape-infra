## 2. Local Infrastructure Analysis

### 2.1 Current Database Architecture

The existing DREAMSCAPE infrastructure supports a hybrid multi-database approach:

#### Terraform Configuration (`/terraform/modules/databases/main.tf`):
- **PostgreSQL**: OCI Autonomous Database with auto-scaling
- **MongoDB**: Self-managed on OCI with replica set configuration
- **Redis**: OCI Redis Cluster for caching
- **Elasticsearch**: Self-managed multi-node cluster

#### Kubernetes Auth Service (`/k8s/base/auth/deployment.yaml`):
- Image: `ghcr.io/dreamscape/auth:latest`
- Database connection via secrets management
- Redis integration for session management
- OAuth integration (Google)
- Health checks and monitoring configured

### 2.2 Database Migration Readiness Assessment

Current readiness score: **MEDIUM-HIGH**

**Ready Components**:
- âœ… PostgreSQL infrastructure configured
- âœ… Backup strategy with OCI Object Storage
- âœ… Health checks and monitoring
- âœ… Security context properly configured
